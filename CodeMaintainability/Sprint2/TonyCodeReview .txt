FILE ----- IItem and all it's implementations ---- AUTHOR --- Tony
	~7 minutes of review
	The code is very minimal and readable. Every IItem contains the same four methods with extremely low coupleing from calling the factory
	and high cohesion.
	Projectile classes are a little more complex but has slightly higher coupling with a little less cohesion from the use of SpriteActive().
	This should be fine though.

FILE ----- Sprites in SpriteClasses/ItemSprites ---- AUTHOR ---- Tony
	~3 minutes of review
	Only definition of source rectangle being handled in the sprites themselves with the destination and draw being handled in the abstract class.
	Very high cohesion and very low coupling as each class only relies ISprite and the abstract class with each doing exactly one thing.
	The projectiles are exactly the same except for having four classes for each type of projectile for determining the direction it is meant to be fired at.

FILE ---- Item Commands ----- AUTHOR ---- Tony
	~2 minutes of review
	Next Item and previous item do exactly what they say they do and has virtually no coupling while doing the one task it sets out to. Relies only on
	GameObjects the singleton for iterating the item across the list.
