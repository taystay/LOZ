		-The code is low coupling as it doesn't have too many interdependence on other code.
		however relies on calling many other states to change the state of link. 
		-The code is high cohesion and specific as it is only for Link's right attack 
		-The code relies 
		-A hypothetical change would be implementing another weapon and it would be easy to do with the current frame work
		however if more and multiple weapons are being adding it could be a long if-else-if and could need to be re-worked then

	-Comments:
		-The code is low coupling and doesn't rely too much on other class
		-The code does have high cohesion as it is only one of the state of link
		-The code does have many private variable and possibly move it into another class such as an abstract class so there is a central set of variable
		instead of repeatedly calling the variable in a different class for a very similar state. 
		-A hypothetical change would be that link has multiple frames and adding it to the list could 
		take a lot of time to do and figure out and how to properly find the correct frame and doing the correct math.
