		There is very little code and it is readable, and each piece of code is necessary. 
    Each different implementation are similar with the same methods and with high cohesion. 
    A change you could make is the use of the ? command, it is not easy to understand by 
    looking at it with all of the different commands on those same lines. Maybe split it up
    a bit more.

		Very small amount of code for what we are trying to do here with the breath. 
    Every line of code is easy to understand and comprehend what is going on. 
    There is no unnecessary lines of code to get rid of.

    Code quality is good. Each variable is named well and has correct conventions. Each
    sprite class only relies on ISprite so it has low coupling and high cohesion. Using the reference
    to the site and using the sprite grid method is a nice touch. Each program has a small amount of 
    code.

		Code quality is done really well. Not much code in the program. Factory does what it 
    is supposed to do in the best way possible. Not much you can change here to make it better.
