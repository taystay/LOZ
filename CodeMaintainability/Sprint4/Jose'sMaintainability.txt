Sprint 4

SpriteStandardizeClass.cs: Jose Berrios
	time: 3 mins

	-comments: The file itself has very low coupling and very high cohesion as it is desinged specifically to remove magic numbers from environment sprites. 

	- There are no glaring issues with this code, but for scalability it might have been a good idea to make a constructor so that more of these static Rectangles could
	be created easily if need be.

[Jose did not create/work on a second file]
