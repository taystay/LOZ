ExteriorCollider.cs : Author Tony D'Alesandro
	-Time: 5 mins

	-Quality: Tony's code quality is overall good. There is a lot of if-else statement in PlaceColliders. The high cyclomatic c
	complexity with all the if-else statement and the possiblities

	-Maintainablitiy: If the the room did not have four door but instead had more than 4 it would be hard to 
	maintain since it would require a new if-else statement. Also the PlaceDoor would begin to grow more and more 
	so maintainability would not be good.


CollisionBehavior.cs: Author Tony D'Alesandro
	-Time: 5 mins

	-Quality: The quality is overall good. A lot of if-else blocks leading to high cyclomatic complexity however for collision 
	it is to be expected. The quality is good with naming convention proper use of splitting the collsiion up and separating 
	it under 2 main collsion type which are link and enemies.

	-Maintainability: If Link or Enemies need a new collsion it would be easy to add however it could possibly lead to a new static class
	to handle the object. The maintainability is rigid and would need to create new static class for different types
	of collision.
