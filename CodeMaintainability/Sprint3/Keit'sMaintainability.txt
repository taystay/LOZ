	-Time: 5 mins

	-Quality: The code is overall very easy to follow. However, there are quite a few magic numbers and room for improvement. He also checks for null which
  isnt neccesarily bad but begs the question if there is a better way to solve that.

	-Maintainablitiy: maintainability is good because it is flexible in how you can design the corresponding CSV file.


ParseToBlock.cs: Author Keit Vu
	-Time: 5 mins

	-Quality: The quality is good. however, there are many magic numbers and the flow is hard to follow. The y value of how tall the room is seems like it
            would be 7 but it is able to change in the loop. The way the basement is implemented could be improved with less magic numbers and a more dynamic height.
            maybe if you have a line for the height and width of the room before reading it you can dynamically start at the right spot, and have a more flexible
            dungeon basement.

	-Maintainability: the code is not very maintainble. If you change a few details in the room part of the CSV its likely there will be many changes that need to be 
                    made in this code.
