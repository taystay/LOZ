All SwitchRoom mouse controller files : Author: Taylor Liu
	-Time: 5 mins

	-Quality: Quality of all files is good. All of these files are generally the same and short and simple
  so it has good quality

	-Maintainablitiy: Since all of the files are similar and work generally the same and are very short
  This code is maintainable. We could try to make just one big file for the mousecontroller in the future instead of having
  files for different directions and movement.


CollisionDetection.cs: Author Taylor Liu
	-Time: 5 mins

	-Quality: The quality is overall good. A lot of if-else  could lead to higher runtimes but we are not worried about that.
  Each collisison type is specified and handled correctly and in a good manner overall. 

	-Maintainability: This code is pretty maintainable, There likely wont be any new collision types or the need to change
  the existing collision types, adding new collision type is simple.
