Sprint 3


CollisionIterator.cs : Jose Berrios
	-Time: 5 mins

	-Quality: Overall code quality is fine. Using nested for each loops gives very bad cyclomatic complexity but we
	currently do not care.

	-Maintainablitiy: If we were to upscale this to a bigger map or having multiple rooms loaded at the same time,
	this would be a problem. As it stands, everything is being compared to each other twice.


SpriteStandardizeClass.cs : Jose Berrios
	-Time: 2 mins

	-Quality: The quality is interesting? I am unsure why we have things being declared as a 0 size Rectangle or initializing Texture2D's to null.
	This shouldn't happen.

	-Maintainability: As I am unsure what this class does right now. I am unsure whether this code is maintainable or not :/
