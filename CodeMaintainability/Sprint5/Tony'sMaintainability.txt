Skeletron.cs: Tony D'Alesandro

	Comments: This codes cohesion is high, having the class being focused on creating the physics
  for the boss

	Maintainability: I think this code is maintainable, you could use this physics logic on other 
  sprites and it could work. Maybe a little bit more clean rope like physics but other than that 
  I think the code is maintainable

FOWFactory.cs: Tony D'Alesandro
	Time: 5 mins
	
	Comment: Code has high cohesion and low coupling, the code does focuses on one thing which is creating
  the FOW affect. Low coupling in that this class does not affect any other classes. 

	Maintainability: This code is easily maintainable, you could use this pretty much on any other game 
  and it would most likely work the same way. The only thing would be starting it on the player character
  which could work differently when porting to other places.
