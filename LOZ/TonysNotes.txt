TONY'S NOTES

CONTROLLER
	- Should have RegisterCommand with a key as the first parameters and 3 parameters corresponding to execute on initial press command, hold command, and release commands

IITERABLE
	- Encapsulates the object that is the iterable item we see in this sprint 2 game. Can for each of all the Iterable Objects. Make a list of ITerables... EASY!
