-------     TODO LIST   ----------

-  (MAYBE TONY, IF NOT PUT NAME HERE) compress link states entierely. Have it be he has stats and based on the states we draw him differently
      - velocity > 0? then break it up and draw moving sprite based on it
      - if you press attack, it sets velocity to zero and stopps link and prevents movement
      - ADVANTAGE: wayyyy less files
   - (TAYLOR) PLEASE DON'T DO THIS <<<<<<<< The way we have it is the way Boggus suggested we do it. There are a lot of files for extremely high cohesion and low coupling.

- (TONY) compress sword items similar to how the portal is being done. 
     -  we do not need 4 class for one item, we do that many times.

- (TONY) cut out some useless commands

- (TONY) start a works cited

- (TONY) delete pngs not being used.

- Fog of war when in dungeon (Camera State responsibility of fading sprites away from a point)

- (TAYLOR) Main screen with an interactive component

- Nightmare mode

- Teleporting item into the boss room (no other way to access it but to defeat dragon and then get the teleporting item)

- (TAYLOR) better win screen

- (TAYLOR) Achievements <<<What they are is a surprise>>>

-------     BUGS    ----------

skeletron states of attack are not working as intended. need to fix

The victory screen should take us to the MainMenu or Quit

(FIXED) Enemies wont update in a very rare case 
    - TotalGameTime.TotalMilliseconds % number eventually never is zero. so our updates were never happening.


(FIXED) Fix sprites drawing dragon 
    - Row and column were initialized to zero and then changed after the first update. meaning dragon (0,0 on the sprite sheet)
        always got drawn first.
