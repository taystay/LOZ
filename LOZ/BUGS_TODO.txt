-------BUGS----------

Fix sprites drawing dragon
    - occurs before the first update to an enemy.
    - changing the dragon sprite off dragon does not change anything. still dragon sprites drawn
    - changing EnemySpriteFactory.CreateDragon() to return a different sprite changes nothing either.

-------OTHER STUFF TODO----------
