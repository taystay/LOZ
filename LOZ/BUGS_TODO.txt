-------BUGS----------

Enemies wont update in a very rare case
    - this has happened before the big refactor night and just happened on 4/12/2022
    - enemies sprites wont update nor do they move. link can hit them and hurt them though.
    - if he can hurt them then they go through the collision.Iterate() but then why arent the enmies being updated
    - prediction: something with the gameTime object
    - other prediction: currentroom is not set to the room he is actually in thus its updating the wrong room?
    -def think its a TotalGame.TotalMillisecond issue where its never divisible by 150/1000. nothing else in the game does that
      and the game time objects you need to be careful with. Guess we can look into that in the future.


Bombing walls and exterior object updating doors
    - bombing wall opens a door (sometimes) and the other side is never really opened
      like there is an invisible block in the way


Fix sprites drawing dragon (FIXED)
    - occurs before the first update to an enemy.
    - changing the dragon sprite off dragon does not change anything.
      still dragon sprites drawn
    - changing EnemySpriteFactory.CreateDragon() to return a different sprite
      changes nothing either.
    - FIX: the enemy sprites do not initialize row and column and thus they
      are zero before an update to them.

-------OTHER STUFF TODO----------

ROOMS CONTAIN SPAWN AND MOVE LOCATION BETWEEN OTHER ROOMS
Force rooms to implement or have some point for where to spawn in going down into the room
and a point for where to go up into the room. it can be nullable and if its not null, then you are allowed
to use the point and maybe this can be useful for left, right, up, down but that might be unneccesary.
However, if we want a big room that is connected to the rest of the rooms, this would be a requirement.
