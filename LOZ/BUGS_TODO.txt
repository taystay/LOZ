-------BUGS----------


Bombing walls and exterior object updating doors
    - bombing wall opens a door (sometimes) and the other side is never really opened
      like there is an invisible block in the way


Fix sprites drawing dragon (FIXED)
    - occurs before the first update to an enemy.
    - changing the dragon sprite off dragon does not change anything.
      still dragon sprites drawn
    - changing EnemySpriteFactory.CreateDragon() to return a different sprite
      changes nothing either.
    - FIX: the enemy sprites do not initialize row and column and thus they
      are zero before an update to them.

-------OTHER STUFF TODO----------
