-------HUD----------

Hud completely updated.

All items, if they make sense to store are in inventory and are stored as a boolean.

wont go into implementation details..

you can use space bar to go to next item in inventory

if you get map it draws it out for you

if you get the compass it where on the map the triforce piece is at.


-------CONTROLLER CHANGES-------

can only use an item if you have it on your b slot. sword default onto Z slot.

made changes to the hud that I thought were well deserved


-------ENEMY DROP CHANGES------

enemies have a chance to drop rupee, clock, or fairy

I saw fairies give some health and were dropped from enemies. so the game reflects that now

also I found out that clocks or stopwatches actually freeze enemies for a certain amount of time
(I set it to 400 updates).

-------DEV ROOM----------

dev room has nice walk way between all the items.
