FILE ---- IEnviornment and all its implementations ---- AUTHOR ---- jose

	all the code is very readable. If you've read one of the IEnviornment objects you've read them all. So not much work to read.
	the naming conventions make sense, the coupling is low but the coehesion seems middle of the road since you have to call a
	sprite factory so there is room to improve upon that.

FILE ---- sprites in /SpriteClasses/BlockSprites ---- AUTHOR ---- jose
	~5 minutes of review
	If you've read one you've read them all. The design pattern is repeated pretty throughly. the coupling and coehesion is very low.
	the variables are named appropriately. The only thing is that the width and height variables had a redundant type cast that I fixed. also texture could be readonly.

FILE ---- Block commands ---- AUTHOR ---- jose

	copy and paste of agreed upon design pattern. Just calls a singletons private variable to iterate in reverse/forward. not even any variables.
