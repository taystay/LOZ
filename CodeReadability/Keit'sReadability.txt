File:  IEnemy and Implementations(Bat, NPC, Dragon, Jelly, Skeleton) -- Author: Keit Vu
	-Time taken: 10 minutes
	-Comments:
		The code is easy to read and understand what is going on. Every implementation of IEnemy follows a similar 
    pattern which makes each different enemy behavior easy to understand and follow. The only confusing thing to 
    understand I would say is the use of the question mark, it makes the code slightly less easy to follow since
    the functionality of the operator is not easy to know.

	-Comments:
		The code is easy to follow. I like how all of the names of the variables
    are easy to understand and make the code as a whole easy to follow in how
    the dragons breath is moving and created.
    
    File: sprites in /SpriteClasses/EnemySprites -- Author: Keit Vu
	-Time taken: 8 minutes
	-Comments:
		Code is very simple to follow. Alot of the code for each of the enemy sprites are very similar. 
    Each variable is named well and explains what is doing clearly.

	-Comments:
		Code has good readability, each variable has a good name. The code makes it easy
    to tell what the program file as a whole is supposed to do.
