FILE ---- IItem and all its implementations ---- AUTHOR ---- Tony
	All of them are insanely easy to read, making a single call to the factory before calling the sprite itself's update function. 
	The projectiles that move across the screen feels a little over-engineered but everyh variable is named very well and makes the code insanely easy to follow.

FILE ---- sprites in /SpriteClasses/ItemSprites ---- AUTHOR ---- Tony
	The iterative item sprites are essentially one line only with setting the frame which is clear as day.
	The sprites that move are very readable as well as we either set multiple frames for animating (which is very well named), or we
	let the IItem class update it's position.

	For the future, we might want to so the same enumerating for the direction of fire by rotating the sprite? (not sure how to do that but it would also
	unlimit us from the four cardinal directions).

FILE ---- Item commands ---- AUTHOR ---- Tony
	Literally one line of code per class and does exactly what it says it will.

	When we implement these items in game with collision and stuff, what commands will these two iterative commands change to?
