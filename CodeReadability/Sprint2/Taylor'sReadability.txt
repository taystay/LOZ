		--The code is overall easy to follow. 
		--I think the variable for the list data structure could be written better so it easier to understand.
		it is hard to identify the difference of 'frame' and 'frames' so I think a better name convention.
		--The Draw method is easy to understand and why there is a if statement to changel the color of link.
		--Lastly, I would say that adding the frames to the list is hard to understand since it is mostly 
		number to create a new rectangle of the frame that Taylor wants for link and hard to follow.
