Sprint 3

ExteriorObjects.cs: author: Tony D'Alesandro
	-time: 5 mins
	
	Readability: I can read most of the the code and can follow along what is happening without thinking about 
		what the src file is trying to say. It is slightly diffificult to follow along the Update method 
		and what it is doing exactly. 


ExteriorColliders.cs: author: Tony D'Alesandro
	-time: 6 mins
	
	Readability: I can somewhat follow along what is happening in PlaceCollider sometimes I get lost on what
		is being done and the flow of the code. Very overwhelming and slightly hard to follow.v
		The PlaceDoors and PlaceDoor is easier to follow and can be seen what is being acheived with those 
		two method and what is being done.
