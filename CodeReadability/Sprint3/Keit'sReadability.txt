	Readability: Readability is very good. There are some magic numbers that seem very easy to get rid of though by making some constant variables.

	Readability: The code is very tricky to follow. Maybe some naming conventions or encapsulation of some details or even some functions can make it exponentially
                more readable. It is likely we are just trying to get functionality but there are lots of magic numbers that I dont quite understand either.
                
                
CollisionDetection.cs: author: Keit Vu

    Readability: The collision detections is very readable. I can follow exactly what is going on and the variables used are named very properly. The gaurd clause
                  used makes it easy to understand when you would not find a collision.
