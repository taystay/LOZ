	-Time: 5 mins
  
  Readability: Every file in that coincides with the mouse controls is very short and easy to read and simple to follow. 

CollisionDetection.cs: Author Taylor Liu
	-Time: 5 mins

Readability: The code is easy to read if you know the reason for the file. The different x and y positions can sometimes
be confusing to understand how each type of collision is checked but overall the naming conventions are good and with some
time it is simple to understand what is happening within the file.
