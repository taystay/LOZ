Sprint 4


FirstDungeon : Tony D'Alesandro
	-Time: 5 mins

	-Readability: The code is clear to follow especially the UpdateControllerer and easy to underderstand what is happening. The variable names are clear and says enough to understand the general idea of the variable. I do not see anything hard to read.


Inventory: Tony D'Alesandro
	-Time: 10 mins

	-Readability: All the the methods name are clear on what the function does. The NextIUtem code black is confusing to understand what is happening own the for loop. The rest of the code block are easy to understand.
